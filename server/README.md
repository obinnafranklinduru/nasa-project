# NASA Mission Control Project

This API lets the mission control dashboard frontend schedule missions, view historical data using the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API), and view upcoming data. The project uses the popular Express.js framework and MongoDB Atlas for the database.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
3. Start the API server by running `npm start`.
4. Test the API by running `npm test`.

## Usage

Once the API server is running, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any other HTTP client to test the endpoints.
